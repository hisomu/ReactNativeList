# Yuser Lazy Loading Test

## Step 1: Install Node, NPM

Install Node and NPM on your machine; this typically requires administrative access, 
e.g. become root or use `sudo` (or use a Windows installer).

You must be running at least Node 4.x.x and npm 3.x.x. You can verify 
what, if any, versions you have installed by running `node -v` and 
`npm -v` in a terminal window.

You can download current versions of these tools [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/).

If you use a Linux-like environment, you are encouraged to use your
package manager to install these tools.

If you use OS X, you may wish to consider installing via [HomeBrew](http://brew.sh/).

## Step 2: Install the NPM dependencies

`$ npm install`

## Step 3: Development server

Runs your app in development mode.

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

Sometimes you may need to reset or clear the React Native packager's cache. To do so, you can pass the `--reset-cache` flag to the start script:

```
npm start --reset-cache
# or
yarn start --reset-cache
```
